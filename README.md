Project Overview
This repository showcases a fully functional, front-end Gamified Task Tracker built for the explicit purpose of learning and validating system design principles through an AI-First development workflow.

The entire application—from feature planning and architectural breakdown to the complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code—was conceived and developed solely through iteration and collaboration with a Generative AI. This project serves as a practical artifact and a case study demonstrating the capability of AI models to translate high-level design requirements into clean, maintainable, and functional code.

System Design Learning Goal
This project is not just a UI; it's a demonstration of System Design Learning. By relying on AI for implementation, the focus shifts entirely to defining system constraints, data flow, and component interaction, effectively using the AI as an accelerated prototyping engine to grasp core architectural concepts. It proves that complex prototypes can be rapidly deployed by mastering the system design requirements.
